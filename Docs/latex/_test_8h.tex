\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\doxylink{class_test}{Test} Base Class for Unit Testing Framework. 

This header file declares the \doxylink{class_test}{Test} base class, which is an essential part of the unit testing framework designed for verifying the correctness and functionality of various components in the project. The \doxylink{class_test}{Test} class provides a generic interface for running individual tests, managing test outcomes (pass/fail), and aggregating test results. It utilizes templates to allow any derived test class to execute its specific test methods. The framework captures exceptions as test failures, reporting the reason for each failure alongside the test\textquotesingle{}s name. It concludes with a summary of all tests run, including the total number of tests, passed tests, and failed tests.

Usage\+: Derived classes should implement the {\ttfamily run\+Tests} method to execute their specific test cases using the {\ttfamily run\+Test} method. This structure allows for flexible and extensive testing across various functionalities within the project.
