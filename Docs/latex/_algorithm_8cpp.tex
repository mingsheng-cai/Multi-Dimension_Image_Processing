\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Provides implementations of sorting and selection algorithms. 

This source file contains the implementation of several algorithms including Quickselect and Quicksort, tailored for both numerical data and strings. The Quickselect algorithm is designed to efficiently find the k-\/th smallest element in an unordered list, while the Quicksort algorithm sorts elements of an array or a vector in ascending order. Both algorithms employ a partitioning approach to organize data around a pivot value, facilitating rapid sorting and retrieval operations. These algorithms are optimized for performance and flexibility, making them suitable for a wide range of applications requiring efficient data organization and retrieval.
