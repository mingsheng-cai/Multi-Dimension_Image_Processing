\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implements functionality to extract 2D slices from a 3D volume. 

The \doxylink{class_slice}{Slice} class provides a method for extracting specific 2D slices from a 3D volumetric dataset, based on given dimensions, raw data, and the desired orientation. The class supports extraction along the \textquotesingle{}x-\/y\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}x-\/z\textquotesingle{}, and \textquotesingle{}y-\/z\textquotesingle{} planes, accommodating a range of visualization and analysis needs. This flexibility allows users to examine the internal structure of the volume from different perspectives, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data. The method validates the requested slice index and plane orientation, ensuring the integrity of the returned slice. It serves as a crucial tool in domains where 3D volumetric data is prevalent, such as medical imaging, geospatial analysis, and scientific research, by simplifying the process of volumetric data exploration.
