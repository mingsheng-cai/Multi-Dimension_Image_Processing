\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \doxylink{class_gaussian2_d_filter}{Gaussian2\+DFilter} class for applying a Gaussian blur to images. 

This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_gaussian2_d_filter}{Gaussian2\+DFilter} class, which is designed to apply a Gaussian blur to images. The Gaussian blur is performed by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel. The class allows for custom kernel sizes and sigma values, providing flexibility in the strength and extent of the blur effect. The Gaussian kernel is generated dynamically based on the provided sigma and kernel size, ensuring that the kernel is properly normalized. The class also supports different padding types to handle image borders. This implementation is part of the Advanced Programming Group\textquotesingle{}s efforts to develop comprehensive tools for image manipulation and processing, enhancing image quality and preparing images for further analysis or display.
